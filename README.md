# Umbraco Courier Contrib

This project contains community contributions for the Umbraco deployment tool, Courier.

Primarily this project offers data-resolvers for the most popular Umbraco community packages - these are used by Courier (and [Umbraco Cloud](https://umbraco.com/cloud)) to aid with the deployment and transferring of content/property-data to a target environment.

### Issues

We encourage you to report any issues you might find with these data-resolvers, so we can have them fixed for everyone!

When reporting issues with a resolver it will help us a whole lot if you can reduce your report to being the absolute minimum required to encounter the error you are seeing.

This means try removing anything unnecessary or unrelated to the actual issue, from your setup and also try reducing the steps to reproduce, to only cover exactly what we would need to do in order to see the error you are getting.

For any questions or issues about this project specifically, please [raise an issue](https://github.com/umbraco/Umbraco.Courier.Contrib/issues) on GitHub.

For any Courier specific enquiries, please use the [Umbraco Issue Tracker (for Courier)](http://issues.umbraco.org/issues/COU).
